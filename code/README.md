# Covert Storage Channel that exploits Protocol Field Manipulation using Reserved Flag field in IP [Code: CSC-PSV-IP-RF]

## Description
This project implements a covert storage channel that exploits protocol field manipulation using the reserved flag field in the IP header. The channel allows for the transmission of binary messages by embedding bits into the reserved flag field of IP packets.
